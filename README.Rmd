**dte-rate-comparison** is a web app to compare DTE rate plans using hourly residential electricity usage data.

## Background

DTE offers multiple rate plans to residential customers.
Most customers are only familiar with the **Residential Electric Service (RES)**, which is the default rate plan.
However customers can opt-in to other rate plans.
Most notable are the **Time of Day (ToD)** and **Dynamic Peak Pricing (DPP)** rates, as the other rate programs
This web app is a simple tool to help DTE residential customers decide whether to adopt an alternative rate plan, either Time of Day or Dynamic Peak Pricing.

DTE residential customers with advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) can download their electricity usage data.

## Deployment

The application is deployed via GitHub Actions to shinyapps.io when code is merged to the `main` branch.

* [R](https://www.r-project.org) - a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics
